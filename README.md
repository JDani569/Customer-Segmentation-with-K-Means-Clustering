# Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering README
  # Overview
This repository demonstrates customer segmentation using K-means clustering, a powerful technique in data analysis and machine learning. Customer segmentation helps businesses group customers based on similarities in behavior, demographics, or other characteristics. This segmentation facilitates targeted marketing strategies, personalized customer experiences, and operational optimizations.

 # Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)

  # Usage
Data Preprocessing:

Cleanse and preprocess your dataset to handle missing values, scale numerical features, and encode categorical variables if necessary.
Applying K-Means Clustering:

Modify the K-means clustering parameters (e.g., number of clusters, initialization method) in customer_segmentation.py to fit your dataset and business objectives.
Run the script to perform clustering and generate customer segments.
Visualizing Results (Optional):

Use visualization techniques (e.g., scatter plots, histograms) to explore cluster characteristics and interpret segment differences.
Modify plotting.py to customize visualizations based on your specific data and clustering results.
